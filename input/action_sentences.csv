1096,3,<Builder> hello
1096,4,<Architect> are u rdy to get to work?
1096,5,<Builder> yes
1096,6,<Architect> ok
1096,7,<Architect> build a 2x1 structure that is blue
1096,8,<Builder> is the structure extending upwards?
1096,9,"<Architect> no, it goes across"
1096,10,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
1096,11,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
1096,12,<Builder> is that good?
1096,13,<Architect> now place 1 blue piece on the left block extending upwards
1096,14,<Architect> yes that is correct
1096,15,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
1096,16,<Builder> like that?
1096,17,"<Architect> yes, now it is finished"
1096,18,<Builder> good job!
1096,19,<Architect> you too builder

1098,1,<Builder> Mission has started.
1098,2,<Architect> hello again builder
1098,3,<Builder> hello
1098,4,<Architect> we will start using green blocks
1098,5,"<Architect> i need you to build 4 green blocks straight from where you are standing, all on the ground"
1098,6,[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
1098,7,[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]

1098,9,[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
1098,10,<Builder> like this?
1098,11,<Architect> yes
1098,12,"<Architect> now i need you to put a green block on either side of the second existing block, on the ground"
1098,13,<Builder> so on the middle blocks?
1098,14,[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
1098,15,[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
1098,16,"<Architect> they need to be attached to the same block, preferable to the one closer to you"
1098,17,<Architect> so it looks like a cross
1098,18,[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
1098,19,[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
1098,20,<Builder> like this?
1098,21,<Architect> perfect
1098,22,"<Architect> now, i need you to place a block diagonal from one of those new blocks, in the forward direction"

1098,24,[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
1098,25,<Builder> like a cactus?
1098,26,<Architect> yes perfect
1098,27,<Architect> now we are done with the green
1098,28,<Architect> can you place a red block above the 4 greens with a space in between the green line and the new block?
1098,29,[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
1098,30,<Builder> here?
1098,31,<Architect> just need 1 block space in between the green and the new red block
1098,32,<Builder> oh i see
1098,33,[Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
1098,34,[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1]
1098,35,<Architect> yes like that
1098,36,<Architect> now can you place 4 yellow blocks on each flat side of the red block?

1098,41,<Builder> its a flower!
1098,42,"<Architect> yes it is, you are very observant builder"
1098,43,"<Architect> to finish, we need 4 orange blocks to fill in the corners of the 3x3 head of the flower"

1101,2,<Builder> hello. what are we building this time?
1101,3,"<Architect> hello builder, one moment"
1101,4,"<Architect> ok, to get started we need to place 4 orange blocks as if they are the corners of a 3x3 square, all of them on the ground"
1101,5,<Builder> can i put them anywhere?

1101,10,[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-5]
1101,11,<Architect> perfect
1101,12,<Architect> one moment while i look at the structure
1101,13,<Architect> the second level of the structure consists wholly of red blocks. 
1101,14,<Architect> start by putting a red block on each orange block

1099,2,<Builder> hello. Whats our mission this time?
1099,3,<Architect> we have a difficult one ahead of us this time builder. bear with me
1099,4,<Builder> describe the structure?
1099,5,<Architect> we will start using red blocks. 
1099,6,"<Architect> if you recall from our previous mission we built an open 3x3 square as the second level of our ""table"
1099,7,<Architect> this shape is now extending upwards instead of laying flat
1099,8,<Builder> okay
1099,9,<Architect> sort of like a window
1099,10,<Builder> can i build anywhere?

1099,19,<Architect> yes i think that will work
1099,20,"<Architect> now please place a red block on the left and right sides of the window, in the middle of each side"
1099,21,[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
1099,22,[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
1099,23,<Builder> these ones?
1099,24,<Architect> yes place them adjacent to those you just removed

1099,31,<Architect> perfect
1099,32,"<Architect> the second half of this structure is the same using purple blocks, but oriented differently."
1099,33,<Architect> i will attempt to start you off step by step though
1099,34,<Builder> so parallel?
1099,35,<Builder> or perpendicular?
1099,36,<Architect> it is attached to our current structure sort of parallel and rotated 90 degrees. 
1099,37,<Architect> anyway please place the first purple block on the rightmost red block

1099,54,[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]

1099,61,<Builder> oh so its on the ground?
1099,62,<Architect> we can start off with the first few blocks and you will see soon
1099,63,"<Architect> the first purple block needs to be attached to the rightmost block, so that it hangs in the air and is closer to you"
1099,64,[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
1099,65,<Builder> here?
1099,66,<Architect> if you move that block to the other side of that red block so that it is on your side and not just an extension
1099,67,[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
1099,68,[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
1099,69,<Architect> yes
1099,70,<Builder> is this the arm of the window?
1099,71,<Architect> nowplease make the open square (window) on top of that new purple block

1099,83,<Architect> ok builder i have bad news but it's an easy fix
1099,84,<Architect> i gave you the wrong side
1099,85,<Builder> on the back or other side?
1099,86,<Architect> if you could do that exact structure so that its on the left side of the red square from where you were standing it will be correct
1099,87,[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]

1100,1,<Builder> Mission has started.
1100,2,<Builder> hello
1100,3,"<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. "
1100,4,<Architect> i will need a moment to look it over
1100,5,<Builder> take your time. 
1100,6,<Builder> just give me instructions when you are ready.
1100,7,"<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. "
1100,8,<Architect> please start 1 square from the left side. 
1100,9,"<Architect> we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side"
1100,10,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
1100,11,<Builder> start here?
1100,12,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
1100,13,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
1100,14,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1]
1100,15,<Architect> yes
1100,16,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
1100,17,<Builder> a C?
1100,18,"<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. "
1100,19,<Architect> you have started correctly. 
1100,20,<Architect> we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
1100,21,"<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean"
1100,22,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
1100,23,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
1100,24,<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
1100,25,"<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. "
1100,26,<Architect> yes this orientation is correct i believe
1100,27,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
1100,28,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
1100,29,<Builder> like this?
1100,30,"<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle"

1100,32,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
1100,33,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
1100,34,<Architect> actually that is a little too far. 
1100,35,<Architect> we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
1100,36,<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
1100,37,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
1100,38,[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
1100,39,[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
1100,40,<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
1100,41,<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
1100,42,<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
1100,43,[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
1100,44,<Architect> yes like that
1100,45,<Builder> go it
1100,46,<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
1100,47,<Architect> yes please
1100,48,[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
1100,49,[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
1100,50,<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. 
1100,51,<Architect> we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. 
1100,52,<Architect> the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. 
1100,53,<Architect> lets move on to the green one
1100,54,<Builder> okay
1100,55,<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
1100,56,<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
1100,57,[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
1100,58,"<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up"
1100,59,<Builder> okay. 
1100,60,<Builder> here?
1100,61,"<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. "
1100,62,<Architect> yes that placement is corrent

1100,73,<Builder> like this?
1100,74,<Builder> is the orientation correct?
1100,75,<Architect> a good effort builder. 
1100,76,<Architect> we need this green one to be flat though. 
1100,77,<Architect> if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect

1100,97,<Builder> okay
1100,98,<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. 
1100,99,<Architect> it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you.

1100,117,<Architect> very good builder
1100,118,<Builder> is that it?
1100,119,<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
1100,120,<Builder> that are perpendicular
1100,121,<Builder> then the interlocking one..
1100,122,"<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. "
1100,123,<Architect> our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat).
1100,124,<Architect> it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. 
1100,125,<Architect> it should extend to the left from where you are now
